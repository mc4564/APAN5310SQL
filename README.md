## APAN5310 SQL Final Project
### Explore Meta Kaggle Dataset to Optimize User Experience


##### Team 2: Linda, Shay, Jingjing, Huiling, Yiqing, Jianglan
The repository contains cleaned datasets, ER diagram and code for ETL and querying processes.

Project goal is to enhanced the data quality for the Kaggle community by designing clear relational entities, normalizing data into third normal form, and establishing efficient ETL processes.

- 8 Kaggle datasets that were previously unstructured and indigestible turned into 17 clean datasets that can now be directly queried using SQL. Besides, we created visualization via dashboards to generate valuable insights that Kaggle leadership can use to drive business decisions.

- Kaggle can gain valuable insights into its user profiles, preferences of competitions and skill sets. Given the knowledge of its user base, Kaggle can increase user experience, satisfaction and loyalty by promoting more suited competitions to users through competition tags and increase reward potentials for users. 

- Kaggle can add value to existing cooperation with host companies by matching more users with applicable skills and better end results to participate in specific competitions. In addition, it can attract and engage with more companies to expand competition offerings. 

With better insights into users and cooperating companies, Kaggle is able to improve both user experience and company benefits, as well as to realize tremendous growth.
